# web-shop
The following example is the implementation of a simplified mini web shop. It consists of customers, products and orders. The goal is first to import CSV files with some example data and then create an API for orders (CRUD operations + attach product + pay). To successfully pay an order, a micro payment provider has to be invoked by the shop.
